## Compiling

`qmake openjkdf2.pro && make && ./openjkdf2`

## Notes

The game currently runs (almost) perfectly with the 8bpp software renderer.

Filenames are case-sensitive to whatever the game wants. Notable files are `resource/jk_.cd`, `resource/Res1hi.gob`, `resource/Res2.gob`, `resource/video/01-02a.smk`, `episode/JK1.gob`, `episode/JK1CTF.gob`, and `JK1MP.gob` in order to get to the menu.
