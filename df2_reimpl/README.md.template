# DF2 Reimplementation

This directory contains a function-by-function reimplementation of DF2 in C. Files are organized as closely to the original game as possible, based on symbols from the Grim Fandango Remaster Android/Linux/macOS port. It also contains the original versions of `byacc` and `flex` for COG script parsing.

## Platforms
OpenJKDF2 supports the following configurations:

| Configuration | Renderer | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x86 Win32/MinGW DLL | Software/DirectX | Win32 hooked build, JK.EXE is patched to load `df2_reimpl.dll` execute `hook_init_win` before JK.EXE's `main` function. Unimplemented functions will fall back to JK.EXE implementations. `df2_reimpl_kvm.dll` is used for the KVM target |
| x86 Linux/SDL2, mmap blobs | OpenGL ES 3.0 | Linux compilation with SDL2 and OpenAL. JK.EXE is memory mapped into the process and used as a "binary blob"; Unimplemented functions will fall back to JK.EXE implementations. |
| 32-bit Linux/SDL2, blobless | OpenGL ES 3.0 | 32-bit Linux compilation with SDL2 and OpenAL. The output executable is a swap-in replacement for JK.EXE, but will be missing functions and will crash on reaching unimplemented code. |
| 64-bit Linux/SDL2 | OpenGL ES 3.0 | 64-bit Linux compilation with SDL2 and OpenAL. Currently buggy, particularly with COG scripts. Works on AArch64/RPi4 with llvmpipe, but V3D has trouble with palettes. |

The following implementations are in-progress or planned:

| Configuration | Renderer | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Emscripten/WebAssembly | WebGL/OpenGL ES | WebAssembly with SDL2 and OpenAL. Runs in a web browser. Since WASM only supports 32-bit pointers, this will likely be less buggy than 64-bit. |
| MacOS AArch64 | OpenGL ES 3.0? Metal? | 64-bit MacOS compilation with SDL2 and OpenAL. Rendering backend is currently undecided. |
| 32-bit/64-bit Windows/SDL2 | OpenGL ES 3.0 | Windows compilation with SDL2 and OpenAL. DirectX dependencies are replaced with SDL2 and OpenAL. |

## Building

Building is currently only supported on Arch Linux, but probably works fine on Ubuntu with the right dependencies.

Dependencies:
```
# All
pacman -S base-devel make python python-pip bison
pip3 install cogapp

# Win32/MinGW
pacman -S mingw-w64

# Linux 32-bit
pacman -S multilib-devel lib32-sdl2 lib32-sdl2_mixer lib32-glew lib32-openal lib32-freealut

# Linux 64-bit
pacman -S clang sdl2 sdl2_mixer glew openal freealut

# WebAssembly
pacaur -S emscripten
```

WIP Ubuntu list:
```
# All
apt install build-essential make python3 python3-pip bison
pip3 install cogapp

# Win32/MinGW
apt install mingw-w64

# Linux 32-bit
#multilib-devel lib32-sdl2 lib32-glew lib32-openal lib32-freealut

# Linux 64-bit
apt install clang libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libopenal-dev libglew-dev libalut-dev

# WebAssembly
#emscripten
```

Add the following to the end of ~/.bashrc:
```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

MacOS:
Before starting, install Xcode. This is required for OpenGL headers, among other things.
```
# All
brew install make python3
pip3 install cogapp

# After installing cogapp, make sure the following is in your ~/.zshrc:
# export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Library/Python/3.8/bin

# Win32/MinGW building
brew install mingw-w64

# MacOS 64-bit
brew install openal-soft freealut sdl2 sdl2_mixer glew
```

### x86 Win32/MinGW DLL
`make`

### x86 Linux/SDL2, mmap blobs
`OPENJKDF2_USE_BLOBS=1 make -f Makefile.linux`

### x86 Linux/SDL2, blobless
`make -f Makefile.linux`

### 64-bit Linux/SDL2
`make -f Makefile.linux64`

### MacOS SDL2
```
make -f Makefile.macos
codesign -s - openjkdf2-64
```

### Emscripten/WebAssembly
`make -f Makefile.emcc`

## TL;DR: What Isn't Implemented, Yet
 - Color overlays (blue on getting items, red on getting hit, blue underwater, etc)
 - Input mapping (for blobless/SDL2, input maps are hardcoded)
 - Subtitles and credits
 - HUD/chat text (top-center)
 - Multiplayer menu and all submenus
   - Multiplayer tally screen
   - Multiplayer character builder
 - Sound menu in Options
 - Display menu in Options
 - Input menu in Options
 - Map view in ESC menu
 - Map view with TAB
 - Using plus or minus to resize the screen (with SDL2, resolution auto-resizes to window size)

## Usage
`df2_reimpl` supports both the KVM target from the directory above as well as WINE/Windows, though no guarantees are made for the addition of ie jkgfxmod, other patches nor other hooks. Since KVM has some issues with imports/exports and stdlib, `df2_reimpl_kvm.dll` is compiled with `-Wl,-e_hook_init -nostartfiles`, while `df2_reimpl.dll` is compiled without those linker flags.

Hooking is done by patching JK.EXE with `JK-hook.ips` (using Lunar IPS or similar). This patch replaces `Window_Main` at offset 0x10db50 with the following:
```
68 70 E7 50 00 FF 15 98 05 8F 00 68 80 E7 50 00 50 FF 15 1C 05 8F 00 FF E0 C3 00 00 00 00 00 00 64 66 32 5F 72 65 69 6D 70 6C 2E 64 6C 6C 00 00 68 6F 6F 6B 5F 69 6E 69 74 5F 77 69 6E 00 00 00
```
which is just some small shellcode for
```
int (*v1)(void); 
v1 = GetProcAddress(LoadLibraryA("df2_reimpl.dll"), "hook_init_win");
return v1();
```
OpenJKDF2 then calls the necessary `VirtualProtect` functions from `hook_init_win`, hooks all the functions it needs and then calls its own implementation of `Window_Main` which was replaced with the loader.

TL;DR for Windows users
- Patch JK.EXE with `JK-hook.ips`
- Compile df2_reimpl
- Copy `df2_reimpl.dll` to the same folder as `JK.EXE`

## Methodology
The bulk of research and documentation occurs in IDA. Every function has been identified to a file prefix (ie `stdHashTable_`) with a corresponding .c/.h file. RenderDroid (`rd*`) and LEC stdlib (`std*`) functions are 90% canonically named, based on symbols from Grim Fandango Remastered.

Reverse engineering is a parallel effort between structure documentation and function identification. Once structures are sufficiently documented, Hex-Rays can be used for decompilation. While most Hex-Rays output works outright, many loops and structures require manual intervention. Output is generally cleaned and tidied to remove redunant stack variables or too-deep nesting. `sizeof` and obvious inlining and macros should also be adjusted as appropriate.

Engine variables and yet-to-be-decompiled functions are referenced using `define` macros and static function pointers, respectively. Once a file is decompiled enough that an engine variable is no longer referenced by non-decompiled code, the variables can be declared in their respective C files. For decompiled functions which are only referenced by non-decompiled functions, a `hook_function` call is added in `main.c` to redirect code execution to `df2_reimpl.dll` from `JK.EXE`.

Progress is tracked using `analyze.py`, `output.map` and `ida_copypaste_funclist_nostdlib.txt`: After compiling `df2_reimpl.dll`, symbols can be compared against the `.idb` to determine how much of the original `.text` is actually in use, and how much has been hooked and replaced.

If you'd like a copy of my IDB to examine functions which haven't been decompiled yet (or for any other use), let me know.

## Linux Partial Compilation (mmap blobs)

`openjkdf2` supports an experimental partial compilation for Linux/SDL2, using `make -f Makefile.linux`. `openjkdf2` can then be copied to the same directory as JK.EXE and run. It can currently access the player selection, singleplayer, options, and level loading screen before reaching unimplemented code.

`mmap` is used to maintain all `.rodata`, `.data`, and `.bss` variables in the same addresses as `JK.EXE`, however if `openjkdf2` invokes an unimplemented function, it will segfault at the unimplemented function address.

The current dependency list (for Arch) is as follows:
```
lib32-sdl2 lib32-glew lib32-openal lib32-freealut 
```

When running on Linux, be sure to have copied the GLSL shaders from `df2_reimpl/resource/shaders/*` to `<JK.EXE base folder>/resource/shaders/*`.

## Current Progress

Generated using `analyze.py`. Some filenames may be inaccurate or incomplete (see `ida_copypaste_funclist_nostdlib.txt` for a full function name listing).
